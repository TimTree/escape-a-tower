Thanks for playing Escape a Tower!

If you downloaded the game, you'll need to extract the ZIP file so the game can run properly. In Windows, simply click on Extract All. In OS X, the ZIP file should automatically be extracted upon opening the file.

After that, to play the game, all you have to do is open Escape a Tower.html. All the other files are assets that are called for while playing. Don't move around any of the files, or else the game won't work the way it should.

Enjoy!
