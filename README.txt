Thanks for playing Escape a Tower!

If you downloaded the game, make sure to extract the ZIP file. In Windows, click on Extract All. In macOS, the ZIP file should automatically extract upon opening the file.

After that, open "index.html" to play the game. All the other files are assets the game calls while playing. Don't move around any of the files, or else the game won't work the way it should.

Enjoy!
